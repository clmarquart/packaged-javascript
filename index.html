title: Packaged JavaScript
---
	<p class="desc">
		Packaged JavaScript aims to reduce the negative effect that JavaScript has on page load time.  In order to 
		accomplish this, two techniques are brought together: JavaScript Loaders and Lazy Loading/Parsing of Scripts.
	</p>
    <p class="desc">
		This is not an attempt to replace other JavaScript Loaders out there, more so to build on the concept.  In order
		to do so, Packaged JavaScript takes an idea Google presented in oorder to reduce 
		<a href='http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/09/gmail-for-mobile-html5-series-reducing.html'>Mobile Gmail Startup Latency</a>. 
		Essentially, the idea is to comment out any JavaScript code that is not needed at the 
		initial load of the page.  When the code is required, it is then eval'd for use by removing 
		its surrounding block comment. 
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
		I wanted to take this idea to the next level. Combine multiple JavaScript files into one 
		single file, leaving a JavaScript Package to be used throughout a site or application.
